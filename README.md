# Optimization methods for VLSI
Very large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by integrating circuits into silicon chips.  With the possibility of shrinking more and more the transistor sizes, the need to pack them in smaller areas has grown accordingly.For this reason, developing smart methods for spacial arrangements of the different components on the chips has become crucial for developing modern devices. The aim of this project is to develop optimization strategies (using established technologies), that given a fixed plate-width and a list of rectangular circuits, is able to place them on the plate so that the lengthof the final device is minimized.
